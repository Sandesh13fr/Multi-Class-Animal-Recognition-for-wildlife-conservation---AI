## Features
- Multi-class classification to identify various animal species.
- Utilizes deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks).
- Supports large datasets with high-resolution images.
- Provides results with high accuracy and robustness.
- Helps in automating wildlife monitoring processes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of various animal species collected for training, validation, and testing. If you are using a public dataset, include details such as:
- Dataset source and licensing information.
- Number of classes/species.
- Number of images in training, validation, and testing sets.

If the dataset is custom-built, describe how it was created and preprocessed.

## Installation
